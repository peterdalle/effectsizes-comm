# Effect sizes from 60 years of communication research

A total of 214 effect sizes from 149 meta-analyses from communication research during 60 years extracted from the study by Rains, Levine, & Weber (2018) into a comma-separated CSV file.

## Headers

- `originalorder` is the order of the effect size as in Rains, Levine, & Weber (2018).
- `field` is one of 6 research fields the effect sizes are grouped into, as in Rains, Levine, & Weber (2018).
- `topic` is a topic that each description is grouped under.
- `description` is a short description of the effect size in question.
- `r` is the mean effect size (Pearson's r).
- `ci_lower` is the lower bound of the 95 % confidence interval of r.
- `ci_upper` is the upper bound of the 95 % confidence interval of r.
- `k` is the number of studies.
- `n` is the number of participants in the specific meta-analysis.
- `reference` is a short reference to the specific meta-analysis (in the format `Author, yyyy`).
- `year` is when the meta-analysis was published (extracted from reference).

Missing values are denoted by `NA`. Fields that contain missing values are `ci_lower`, `ci_upper`, `n` and `k`.
